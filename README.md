# Design-Patterns-Demo
A Repository that implements some forms of software design patterns
This Project Implements all the three forms of Design Patterns (Creational, Structural and Behavioural), as such I have implemented five 
types of design patterns namely:<br /><br />
-> Factory Pattern <br />
-> Prototype Pattern <br />
-> Strategy Pattern <br />
-> Composite Pattern <br />
-> Facade Pattern <br /><br />
They have all been implemented in separate packages with <strong>"com."</strong> as the prefix to all package names followed by the name of the pattern being implemented.
<br /><br /><em>This simple implementation focuses on some forms of problems that can be solved using a particular type of design pattern.</em>
<br /><br />An issue log may be opened in case of bug related concerns.
